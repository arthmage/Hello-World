# Vector3

* Unity use left-handed coordinate system.

### Vector3 Function
* Vector3.forward = Vector3(0, 0, 1)
* Vector3.back = Vector3(0, 0, -1)
* Vector3.left = Vector3(-1, 0, 0)
* Vector3.right = Vector3(1, 0, 0)
* Vector3.up = Vector3(0, 1, 0)
* Vector3.down = Vector3(0, -1, 0)
* Vector3.one = Vector3(1, 1, 1)
* Vector3.zero = Vector3(0, 0, 0)
